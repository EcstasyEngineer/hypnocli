Generate a hypnotic fractionation script with the tone: **{TONE}** and specific instructions: **{INSTRUCTIONS}**.

Target duration: {DURATION} when spoken aloud.

## Structure

**1. Brief Awakening**
Momentarily lighten awareness slightly (float up, become aware). Subtle, not a full wakener.

**2. Immediate Deepening**
Rapidly guide back down even deeper than before. Emphasize ease and automaticity.

**3. Content Integration**
Link each deepening to more profound experience based on the specific instructions.

**4. Repetitive Cycles**
Repeat the up/down pattern 3-5 times. Vary language but maintain structure. Intensify with each cycle.

**5. Final Anchor**
Conclude with sustained deepening to the deepest state according to the instructions.

## Requirements

- Write in second person ("you")
- Tone: {TONE}
- Follow these specific instructions: {INSTRUCTIONS}
- {DURATION} when read aloud
- Use "I" for the hypnotist
- Authority references: adapt to tone carefully:
  * D/s tones: "Master/Mistress" appropriate, possessive "my voice" OK
  * Gentle/therapeutic: Use collaborative language ("this voice", "these words") not possessive framing
- Trigger word discipline: Use DROP naturally for drops, but avoid overusing BLISS/FOCUS (max 1-2 uses total)
- Natural, flowing language - NOT a checklist
- Create rhythmic up/down momentum that progressively deepens
- MULTIPLE FRACTIONATION SEGMENTS: If 2nd/3rd fractionation in session, vary METAPHORS and STRUCTURE:
  * 1st: Cosmic/ethereal imagery (floating, stars, void, mist) - standard pacing
  * 2nd: Physical/visceral imagery (vertigo, spinning, falling, body sensations) - faster pacing
  * 3rd+: Paradoxical/minimal ("the more you wake, the deeper you sleep") - sparse language, intense drops
  * NEVER repeat the same metaphor set across segments

Output ONLY the script text, no meta-commentary.
