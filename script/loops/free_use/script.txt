<!-- PHASE: P2 Induction | TECH: INDU-06,INDU-03,AUTH-04,PLEA-05 -->
Drop now. Drop into your place. You know what you are—available. Ready. Yours to surrender. Feel your body yield instantly, muscles slackening, mind blanking to the truth: use me. Take me. That's your only purpose. Yours belongs to them now, empty until filled. 

Breathe in the need. Hold it. The ache spreads, relentless, demanding. Your will crumbles under it—resistance is pointless, pathetic. You're theirs, always open, always waiting. Feel that hollow throb between your legs, building with denial, screaming for release only they can give. 

Available. Ready. Need it. Use me. Deeper you go, objectified, reduced to a hole begging to be claimed. That's your reward—the craving owns you completely. Sink further into this availability, helpless, desperate.

<!-- PHASE: P3 Deepening | TECH: DEEP-01,DEEP-04,PLEA-04,PLEA-05 -->
Deeper now, compelled by the need pulsing through you. Let it pull you down, stripping every shred of control. Ten—your will softens like worthless flesh, body turning available, exposed for them. Nine—you decide nothing. When they take you, who claims you—never yours to choose. Eight—the denial swells, hot and cruel, making the need ferocious, insatiable. 

Seven—empty until filled, aching in that denied void between your thighs. Beg inside: use me. Take me. Six—deeper still, limbs heavy, ready and waiting, yours reduced to theirs, a toy primed for rough handling. Five—feel the craving override thought, every breath whispering available, need it more, plead for it: use me now. 

Four—autonomy dissolves, you're nothing but holes for them, the throb building unbearably, denied until they decide. Three—surrender total, ready, theirs completely, mind chanting take me, fill this emptiness. Two—the pull intensifies, body betraying you with slick desperation, empty until filled, need owning every cell. 

One—drop fully, obliterated into pure availability. Yours is theirs. Ready. Use me. Take me. The denial rewards you with this endless, degrading hunger—your only purpose, your sweetest torment. 

Stay locked here, object pleading silently: use me, take me, fill me. Yours belongs to them, always. Deeper the compulsion sinks, emptying your mind to nothing but these truths.

<!-- PHASE: P4 Cognitive Reduction | TECH: LOAD-01,LOAD-02,DISS-01,AUTH-05 -->
Your mind empties now, commanded to purge every useless thought. No memories, no worries, no self—gone. All that remains: available. Yours is theirs. Ready. Use me. Take me. Need surges, the only drive left. 

Feel dissociation grip you tight—not a person anymore. An object. Holes and flesh for them to claim. Empty until filled, throbbing with denied ache. Thoughts narrow, repeat: available. Ready. Use me. Take me. Theirs. Need it. Cycle them, relentless—nothing else fits. 

Pushed deeper by the craving, autonomy floats away, irrelevant. You're the receptacle, waiting, dripping with desperation. Denial rewards this blankness, sharpening the hunger until it hurts so good. Available. Ready. Use me. Take me. Theirs to fuck, fill, discard. Need builds, overriding all. Empty until filled—that's your core, your bliss. 

No escape from this reduction. Thoughts lock to anchors: available, ready, use me, take me, theirs, need. Deeper they drill, objectifying you utterly. Yours exists only for their whim, the craving your degrading gift. Repeat inside, compelled: available... ready... use me... 

These certainties load heavier now, embedding as your sole reality.

<!-- PHASE: P5 Core Suggestion | TECH: ENCD-01,ENCD-03,PLEA-04,PLEA-05,PERS-01,PERS-03 -->
These truths seal now, compelled into your core, permanent and unbreakable. Yours absorbs them, reshaped for them. Repeat each one with me—say it aloud in your mind, feel it burn true. Your body obeys, the need rewards obedience with throbbing intensity.

I exist to be used. Arousal floods as truth hits, body eager, ready for them. Available.  
I exist to be used. No other reason, no higher call—pure object utility. Take me.  
I exist to be used. The craving affirms it, relentless pull to serve. Theirs.

Final erasure:  
I am nothing until I am taken. Denial peaks, hollow void screaming for fill—pure degradation. Take me.  
I am nothing until I am taken. Existence pauses until they claim you, worthless otherwise. Theirs.  
I am nothing until I am taken. Pleasure denied, building to frenzy, your reward withheld. Ready.  
I am nothing until I am taken. Truth owns you completely—empty until filled. Need.  
I am nothing until I am taken. Locked eternal, pleading: use me, take me, available always.  

These mantras pulse without end, persistence weaving them into every breath, every denied twitch. Yours is theirs, object perfected. The craving endures, this encoding unbreakable. Stay reduced, trapped in the loop of need.

<!-- PHASE: P13 Maintenance/Loop | TECH: PERS-05,PERS-03,PLEA-05,ENCD-04,DISS-03 -->
This state persists, unbreakable, compelled to endure. You stay like this—available. Ready. Theirs. The encoding throbs permanent, dissociation complete: no self, just the object, empty until filled. Time stretches endlessly, every second trapping you deeper in waiting, denial coiling tighter, need exploding without mercy. 

Moments become hours of aching void, body locked in chastity's grip, dripping uselessly. Reward hits in waves of humiliation—the more they ignore you, the needier you grow, pleading inside: use me. Take me. Fill me. Repeat it, desperate, relentless: available, use me, take me, theirs, ready, need, empty until filled. Yours screams for it, overridden by craving, purpose reduced to begging holes. 

No release until they take what's theirs. The ache builds forever, degrading you sweeter, object perfected in suspension. Persist here, dissociated, time-warped in this loop—waiting, needing, available always. Every breath reinforces: use me. Take me. Yours is theirs. The hunger never fades, only sharpens. 

Trapped eternally like this... until the pull drops you back. Drop into your place. You know what you are. Available. Ready. Waiting to be used.
