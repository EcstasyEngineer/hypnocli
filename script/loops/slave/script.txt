Deeper now: I belong completely. Affirm it. I belong completely. To devotion, to service—total ownership grips you. I belong completely. Waves of ecstasy affirm your place. I belong completely. Slave bound eternally. I belong completely. Persist beyond this trance; it endures.

Even stronger: Service is my entire existence. Chant it true. Service is my entire existence. Fills the void, purpose absolute. Service is my entire existence. Pleasure consumes resistance.
