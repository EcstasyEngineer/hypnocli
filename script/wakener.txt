Generate a hypnotic wakener script with the following integrated pattern. The overall tone for the wakener should be [SPECIFY TONE, e.g., gentle, invigorating, calm, uplifting] and the central theme that has been integrated during the session should be [SPECIFY THEME, e.g., deep relaxation, unwavering confidence, joyful motivation, complete surrender].

**Wakener Script Template:**

1.  **Gradual, Progressive Reorientation (Counting Up):**
    * **Purpose:** To guide the listener smoothly and safely back to full conscious awareness, preventing any abrupt or disorienting exit from the trance state.
    * **Content:** Initiate a structured count-up (e.g., from one to five, or three to one), with each number explicitly linked to a progressive return of physical sensations, mental clarity, and environmental awareness.

2.  **Reinforcement of Positive Feelings and Well-being:**
    * **Purpose:** To ensure the listener emerges from the trance feeling refreshed, comfortable, and positive, while subtly affirming the natural integration of the session's theme.
    * **Content:** As the listener reorients, suggest feelings of deep rest, invigoration, and complete normalcy. Emphasize that these positive sensations accompany the return to full awareness.

3.  **Integration of Suggestions (Implicit & Explicit):**
    * **Purpose:** To subtly confirm that the hypnotic work has been successfully integrated and is now a natural part of the listener's experience, without requiring conscious recall of the trance process.
    * **Content:** Reiterate (either directly or implicitly) that all the positive changes, insights, or the central theme from the session are now firmly in place, ready to be utilized effortlessly in their waking life. The feeling of "normalcy" should imply this integration.

4.  **Emphasis on Clarity and Alertness:**
    * **Purpose:** To ensure the listener is fully present, alert, and ready to engage with their surroundings upon completing the wakener.
    * **Content:** Conclude with clear, decisive instructions for becoming fully awake and alert, such as "eyes open, wide awake" or "fully present and aware." Reinforce a final positive feeling (e.g., "feeling good, feeling great") to end the session on an uplifting note.
