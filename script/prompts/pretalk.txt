Create desire to engage by linking listening to positive outcomes. Introduce the session content naturally based on the instructions.

**3. Justification & Safety**
Explain how hypnosis works in a way that reduces resistance. Frame influence as natural and beneficial.

**4. Readiness for Trance**
Prepare the listener for receptivity. Position mental openness as ideal for receiving the session content.
