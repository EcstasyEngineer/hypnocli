Generate a hypnotic post-hypnotic suggestion script with the tone: **{TONE}** and specific instructions: **{INSTRUCTIONS}**.

Target duration: {DURATION} when spoken aloud.

## Structure

**1. Amnesia & Integration**
Suggest conscious memories fade while positive changes integrate deeply at the unconscious level.

**2. Trigger Definition**
Establish clear sensory, cognitive, or environmental cues that will automatically activate the content specified in the instructions.

**3. Future Pacing**
Describe how the content will effortlessly re-emerge whenever triggers are encountered in the future.

**4. Natural Integration**
Ensure suggestions feel completely natural and beneficial within everyday life, not imposed.

**5. Content Permanence**
Solidify the content as an inherent, permanent quality that's always accessible, following the specific instructions.

## Requirements

- Write in second person ("you")
- Tone: {TONE}
- Follow these specific instructions: {INSTRUCTIONS}
- {DURATION} when read aloud
- Use "I" for the hypnotist
- Authority references: adapt to tone carefully:
  * D/s tones: "Master/Mistress" appropriate, possessive "my voice" OK
  * Gentle/therapeutic: Use collaborative language ("this voice", "these words") not possessive framing
- Natural, flowing language - NOT a checklist
- Make future activation feel automatic and effortless
- Trigger word discipline: Only mention established triggers 2-3 times to reinforce, not repetitively

Output ONLY the script text, no meta-commentary.
