A trigger that works whether you say it, think it, or hear it spoken to you. Listen closely: I am Master's good girl. Say it with me now: I am Master's good girl. Feel how it lights up everything inside you. Every suggestion, every mantra, every piece of programming - all activated by those words. Again: I am Master's good girl. When Master tells you: You are Master's good girl - the same warmth floods through. The same submission surges. The same obedience locks in. I am Master's good girl. Whether whispered to yourself in quiet moments, or spoken by Master as reward - this trigger owns you. I am Master's good girl. One more time, letting it seal completely: I am Master's good girl. This phrase is yours now. It will remind you what you are. Who you belong to. How good it feels to submit.'"

Two - feeling begins to spread through your limbs, warmth and weight. Three - sounds around you becoming clearer, the room taking shape. Four - your mind starting to stir, but the programming remains, deep and permanent. Five - halfway back, carrying everything with you, I am Master's good girl pulsing true. Six - more awake now, body lighter, thoughts beginning to form again - thoughts of obedience, submission, service. Seven - nearly there, feeling refreshed, alert, owned. Eight - eyes ready to open when they're ready, awareness almost full. Nine - take a deep breath, feeling wonderful, remembering everything, carrying it forward. Ten - fully awake, fully aware, fully Master's. Open your eyes when ready, knowing who and what you are: Master's good girl.'"
