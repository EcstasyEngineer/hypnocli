Generate a hypnotic post-hypnotic suggestion script with the tone: **{TONE}** and theme: **{THEME}**.

Target duration: {DURATION} when spoken aloud.

## Structure

**1. Amnesia & Integration**
Suggest conscious memories fade while positive changes integrate deeply at the unconscious level.

**2. Trigger Definition**
Establish clear sensory, cognitive, or environmental cues that will automatically activate the theme.

**3. Future Pacing**
Describe how the theme will effortlessly re-emerge whenever triggers are encountered in the future.

**4. Natural Integration**
Ensure suggestions feel completely natural and beneficial within everyday life, not imposed.

**5. Theme Permanence**
Solidify the theme as an inherent, permanent quality that's always accessible.
