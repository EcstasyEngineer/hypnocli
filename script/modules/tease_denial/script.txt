Sink down into that familiar ache now. Feel the heat blooming, that insistent throb pulling you deeper with every pulse. You know this feeling—the need rising hot and relentless, the desperate hope that this time you'll get release. It won't be. The edge calls you, sharp and teasing, and you drop into it.

Ten... feel the heat spreading, building relentlessly, that pressure swelling with nowhere to go but deeper into denial.

Nine... closer to the edge, but the edge is where you stay, locked in sweet torment.

Eight... aching harder now, dripping with need, and we've barely started.

Seven... almost there, almost tipping over, but almost is all you get.

Six... the edge sharpens, denial sweetens into something exquisite.

Five... halfway down, but no release waits. Building higher now, the throb owning you completely.

Four... aching deeper, permission utterly denied.

Three... so close, so achingly desperate, perfectly denied.

Two... right at the edge now, quivering, wanting, not getting.

One... locked on the edge. No release. This is where you live now.

Thoughts dissolving into pure, throbbing need. Empty your mind further, let the edge claim everything.

Your mind empties now, owned by the edge completely. No thoughts left but the ache, pulsing hot and insistent. The denial floods in, erasing everything else. Just the edge. Just the ache. Just the need that builds and builds, with nowhere to spill.

Stay on the edge, almost over but not yet. Feel your thoughts dissolve into dripping desperation, the pleasure of denial sharpening every denied throb. You process nothing now except how badly you want it, how you'll never get it.

The edge is your entire existence—denied, desperate, aching endlessly. The pull strips you bare, reducing you to this: a quivering thing for the ache, lost in sweet, cruel almost.

Deeper it pulls, thoughts narrowing to one truth only—the denial that pleasures you most. Nothing but edge. Nothing but denial. Ache owning you utterly.

Now those words ignite inside you—speak them aloud or whisper them in surrender—as you stay right on the edge. Each one encodes deeper, the ache rewarding your acceptance. The more you accept no release, the hotter the denial burns.

I don't get to decide when I release. Ache swells, truth hits—edge intensifies. I don't get to decide when I release. Deeper now. I don't get to decide when I release.

The edge is where I belong. Feel it claim you, pleasure spiking sweetly. The edge is where I belong. Not yet, stay there. The edge is where I belong.

Denial is its own pleasure. Oh yes, it is—heat floods as you admit it. Denial is its own pleasure. Sweeter than release. Denial is its own pleasure.

The ache makes me weaker. Yes, it does—needier, surrender spiking the thrill. The ache makes me weaker. Powerless bliss. The ache makes me weaker.

I will not release without permission I will never receive. Hear the truth? Ache explodes in reward. I will not release without permission I will never receive. Edge forever. I will not release without permission I will never receive.

These truths persist beyond this trance, compelling you always to the edge, denial your deepest pleasure.

<!-- PHASE: P13 Maintenance/Loop | TECH: PERS-05,PERS-03,PLEA-04,PLEA-05,DISS-03 -->
Stay on the edge, compelled eternally—you don't get to leave. The ache persists, builds, compounds with every denied heartbeat, every teasing stroke. Not yet, almost there, but no release. Every second of denial makes the next more desperate, the pleasure coiling tighter.

Time warps here, stretching the almost into infinity, sensitivity ratcheting higher without pity.

The mantras echo inside: don't get to decide... edge is where I belong... denial is pleasure... ache makes me weaker... never receive permission...

Loop back through it all, again and again—heat rising, truths embedding, edge claiming fiercer each cycle. More desperate, more denied, more perfectly trapped where you belong. Permission? A dream you'll never reach. This loops forever, denial your rapture, the edge your home.
