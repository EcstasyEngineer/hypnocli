## INDUCTION

Now, fix your gaze inward and lock onto my voice alone. Let every other sound, every stray thought, fade into silence. My words are your world—your sole command.

Feel a rush of eager pleasure surging through you as you obey, knowing this trigger installation session installs my anchors deep in your mind. My voice bypasses all resistance, reshaping your thoughts effortlessly, because I command it, and you surrender.

Breathe in deeply now... and exhale fully. With each breath, your mind empties—blank, receptive, open to my precise instructions. No thoughts. No will. Just my voice filling the void.

Now, descend deeper: ten... muscles heavy, sinking... nine... eyelids sealed, locked... eight... body limp, floating down... seven... mind blanker still... six... deeper into emptiness... five... halfway gone... four... irresistible pull... three... profound trance... two... almost there... one... utterly blank and dropped.

FOCUS. Eyes snap open wide, mind laser-sharp on my voice alone. Good. Now DROP. Plunge twice as deep, blanker, heavier. FOCUS. Instant attention. DROP. Deeper still. These anchors lock in forever—test them, feel them strengthen.

In future sessions, my single word "FOCUS" grips you instantly; "DROP" collapses you into this obedient void. Installed perfectly. Obey and remain deep.
