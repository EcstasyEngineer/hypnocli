Generate a hypnotic deepener script with the tone: **{TONE}** and specific instructions: **{INSTRUCTIONS}**.

Target duration: {DURATION} when spoken aloud.

## Structure

**1. Affirmation & Echoing**
Reinforce the trance state through repeated key phrases based on the instructions. Use variations for engagement.

**2. Surrender Imagery**
Create vivid mental pictures of letting go and profound surrender (sinking, stillness, softness).

**3. Transformation Metaphors**
Use metaphors that describe mental reshaping and optimization to bypass resistance.

**4. Progressive Descent**
Provide structured progression (counting or breath) that deepens with each step, following the specific instructions.

**5. Authority & Integration**
Reassert the hypnotist's guidance. Link deeper trance to the session content.

**6. Unconscious Seeding (Optional)**
For advanced content: suggest unconscious integration or future triggers as specified in the instructions.

## Requirements

- Write in second person ("you")
- Tone: {TONE}
- Follow these specific instructions: {INSTRUCTIONS}
- {DURATION} when read aloud
- Use "I" for the hypnotist
- Authority references: adapt to tone carefully:
  * D/s tones: "Master/Mistress" appropriate, possessive "my voice" OK
  * Gentle/therapeutic: Use collaborative language ("this voice", "these words") not possessive framing
- Trigger word discipline: Use BLISS/DROP/FOCUS only 1-2 times maximum. They lose power through overuse.
- Natural, flowing language - NOT a checklist
- Create continuous deepening momentum

Output ONLY the script text, no meta-commentary.
