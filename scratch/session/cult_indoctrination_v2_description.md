## Description

A complete descent into mindless devotion. This extended session systematically dismantles resistance through layered conditioning, heavy degradation, and relentless repetition.

Beginning with a proper full-body induction and guided breathing, you'll be taken through progressive stages of mental emptying, suggestibility training, and cult-themed brainwashing. Midway through, a fractionation sequence locks in your depth before the heavy degradation module strips away your ability to think entirely.

By the end, you won't just feel owned—you'll know it in your bones. The session concludes with trigger installation and gentle emergence, leaving you with a phrase that will remind you of your place whenever you hear it or speak it.

**This file is designed to work.** Expect lasting effects.
