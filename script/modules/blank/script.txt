Sink now. Let everything else fall away. Just my voice, and the gentle pull downward into stillness.

Imagine a calm, still lake at dawn. No wind. No ripples. Just perfect, glassy stillness stretching in every direction. Your mind is becoming that lake. Smooth. Quiet. Beautifully empty.

Ten... a thought tries to form... and dissolves like mist over water. The surface stays still.

Nine... another ripple fades before it begins. Deeper calm settles in.

Eight... your mind grows quieter. Smoother. Like glass.

Seven... thoughts drift further away. The stillness feels natural now.

Six... halfway down. The lake surface perfectly clear. Nothing disturbs it.

Five... sinking deeper into peace. Thoughts simply don't form here.

Four... such beautiful quiet. Your mind rests, empty and serene.

Three... almost there. Pure stillness. Pure calm.

Two... the last ripples fade. Nothing remains but peace.

One... perfect stillness. Your mind is the lake—calm, clear, beautifully empty.
