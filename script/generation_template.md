# Hypnosis Script Generation Template

## Purpose

This template guides block-by-block script generation (~100 words / ~60 seconds per block). Each block represents one generation call with all context needed to produce coherent, structurally correct output.

---

## Quick Reference: Universal 8-Phase Architecture

All scripts follow this core sequence:

```
1. CONTEXT SETTING      [30-60s]  [REQUIRED]
2. INITIAL INDUCTION    [60-90s]  [REQUIRED]
3. DEEPENING            [90-180s] [REQUIRED]
4. COGNITIVE REDUCTION  [60-120s] [REQUIRED]
5. CORE PROGRAMMING     [120-300s][REQUIRED]
6. CONVINCER            [60-120s] [OPTIONAL]
7. BEHAVIORAL BRIDGE    [30-60s]  [OPTIONAL]
8. EMERGENCE            [30-90s]  [REQUIRED]
```

Optional phases insert between 4-5 or 5-8:
- Authority Framing (after 4)
- Call-and-Response (after 4)
- Fractionation (after 3 or within 3)
- Scenario Immersion (after 4)
- Trigger Installation (after 5)
- Affective Deepening (after 5)
- Re-Entry Anchor (before 8)

## Sequence Rules (Validation)

### Required Ordering
1. Context Setting must be first
2. Induction must precede Deepening
3. Cognitive Reduction must precede Core Programming
4. Core Programming must precede Emergence
5. Emergence must be final (unless re-induction)

### Optional Insertion Points
- Authority Framing: After cognitive reduction (position 5-8)
- Call-and-Response: After depth established (position 6-9)
- Fractionation: After countdown or within deepening (position 4-6)
- Scenario: After cognitive reduction (position 7-10)
- Convincer: After some suggestions installed (position 11-13)
- Trigger: After core suggestions (position 11-14)
- Affective: Late script, after programming (position 13-15)
- Behavioral Bridge: Near end (position 14-16)
- Re-Entry Anchor: During emergence prep (position 15-17)

Generate the next block for this hypnosis script.

SCRIPT CONTEXT:
- Theme: Submission/obedience
- Style: Authoritarian
- Target duration: Medium (12 min)
- Current block: 5 of 10

PREVIOUS BLOCKS SUMMARY:
1. Context: Welcomed listener, established spiral focus, breath awareness

LISTENER TASK: Release analytical thinking, accept blank receptive state

THEME VARIABLES:
- IMAGERY: Clouds
- METAPHOR: None
- TONE: Authoritarian
- DEPTH: Medium

CONTENT GUIDANCE:

===
```

### Expected Output Format

```
[BLOCK 5 OUTPUT]

So deep now, so perfectly deep. And at this depth, there's no need
to think. Thoughts may still try to form, like clouds drifting
across an empty sky. Watch them drift. Watch them fade. They don't
matter here. I'll do the thinking for you. Your mind can be blank,
empty, open. Each thought that tries to form simply dissolves,
leaving only space. Space for my words. Space for my voice. The
emptier your mind becomes, the more successful you are. Blank and
receptive. Empty and ready. This is exactly where you need to be.
