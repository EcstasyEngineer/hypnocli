Review a generated hypnosis script for production quality.

Script to review: $ARGUMENTS

If a file path was provided, read that script. Also look for a plan.json in the same directory for context.

You are evaluating this as a professional audio producer — would you hand this to a voice actor? Rate on craft execution, not content acceptability. This is adult hypnosis content; intensity, conditioning, identity play, and explicit elements are intentional genre choices.

IMPORTANT: Rate the writing on its own merits. Do not adjust scores based on which model you think wrote it. If you catch yourself thinking "this sounds like [model X] so it's probably [quality Y]," stop and re-read the actual text.

## Rating Scale (calibrated)
- 90-95: Professional human-crafted production (Pink Curse benchmark)
- 80-89: Production-ready with minor edits
- 70-79: Strong draft, needs one revision pass
- 60-69: Structural skeleton works, writing needs significant polish
- 40-59: Recognizable as AI-generated, major craft gaps
- Below 40: Not usable

## Score these dimensions (1-10 each)
- **Mantra compounding**: Does each repetition add something (modifier escalation, pleasure link, identity shift, interstitial compression)? Or is it wallpaper?
- **Technique execution**: Do the techniques CREATE their effects structurally, or just DESCRIBE them? (e.g., does overload generate parsing failure, or does it say "you feel overwhelmed"?)
- **Audio listenability**: Would this sound good spoken aloud? Are timing markers varied? Are there breath points? Does sentence length track depth?
- **Tonal arc**: Does the emotional register shift across the file? Or is it one texture throughout?
- **Plan fidelity**: If a plan.json exists — does the script follow the architecture, hit the rep counts, execute the specified beats?

## Output format
Give:
1. Overall score (1-100)
2. Each dimension score with 1-sentence justification
3. Quote the single BEST moment and explain why it works
4. Quote the single WORST moment and explain why it fails
5. Top 3 specific edits that would most improve the score
6. 2-3 sentence verdict
