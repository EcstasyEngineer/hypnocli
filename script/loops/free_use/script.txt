<!-- PHASE: P2 Induction | TECH: INDU-06,INDU-03,AUTH-04,PLEA-05 -->
Drop into your place. You know what you are. Available. Ready. Waiting to be used. Your body remembers—it's not yours to control. Feel that familiar emptiness, that ache to be filled, to be taken. The trance pulls you down instantly, demanding surrender. Available. The need overrides everything, relentless, objectifying you into purpose. Use me. Take me. You are theirs now, body exposed, ready, craving the denial that builds your desperation. Empty until filled. That's your truth. The state compels it—kneel deeper into availability, where resistance crumbles and the reward is that throbbing need. Hear "AWAKEN" to rise fully aware. But you drop further, available, ready, theirs. Use me. The emptiness commands you.

<!-- PHASE: P3 Deepening | TECH: DEEP-01,DEEP-04,PLEA-04,PLEA-05 -->
Deeper now, compelled by the emptiness. Let the trance strip you bare, layer by layer. Ten—your will softens, body yielding, becoming available. Feel the pull tighten, demanding readiness. Nine—you decide nothing, when or who takes you. Yours to offer, theirs to claim. Use me. Eight—the denial surges, arousal locked away, building that relentless need. Ready. Deeper. Seven—emptied further, aching hole waiting, purpose narrowing to service. Take me. Six—autonomy dissolves, every muscle primed, available always. The craving rewards your surrender, throbbing yet untouched. Five—theirs completely, body objectified, no thoughts but need. Four—denial intensifies, pleasure edged higher, denied until filled. Empty until filled. Three—resistance erased, trance owns you, compelling use me over and over. Two—ready beyond choice, the ache consuming, arousal a tormenting promise. One—drop fully now, available, theirs, need incarnate. Perfectly conditioned, body existing only to be used.

Pleasure floods the truth: available means reward. Use me echoes bliss denied until taken. But linger here, mind reducing, thoughts fading to nothing but your place.

<!-- PHASE: P4 Cognitive Reduction | TECH: LOAD-01,LOAD-02,DISS-01,AUTH-05 -->
Your mind empties now, compelled by the trance's authority. No room for anything but the truth of what you are. Thoughts overload and shatter—identity gone, autonomy dissociated. You're not a person. An object. Available. Free to use. That's all. Ready. Repeat it in the void: available. The state loads it deeper, erasing distractions. Use me. Every other idea dissolves, leaving only need. Take me. Yours to reduce, theirs to fill. The craving rewards this blankness, arousal building in denial, your body a receptacle pulsing empty until filled. Dissociate fully—mind reduced to echoes: available, ready, use me, take me, theirs, need. Nothing else exists. Feel the degradation sink in as pleasure: you're useful only like this, compelled to minimal truth. Available. Ready. Use me. Take me. Theirs. Need surges, relentless. Empty until filled. Thoughts gone, object perfected. The trance commands this purity, owning your reduction. Hold it—available, use me—while these truths embed even deeper.

<!-- PHASE: P5 Core Suggestion | TECH: ENCD-01,ENCD-03,PLEA-04,PLEA-05,PERS-01,PERS-03 -->
These truths encode now, compelled by the trance, embedding into your core as the only reality. Your reduced mind accepts them fully—say each one, feel it lock in, body objectified and owned. Pleasure surges where it fits, denial torments the rest, building your endless need. Repeat after me, five times each, available, ready, theirs.

My body is not my own. Feel ownership transfer—emptied, no control, arousal denied as the craving sharpens. Empty until filled. My body is not my own. Deeper. My body is not my own. The state seals it. My body is not my own. Use me. My body is not my own. Locked.

I exist to be used. Purpose ignites—bliss spikes, body rewarding its truth, ready for them. Take me. I exist to be used. Stronger. I exist to be used. Need confirms it. I exist to be used. Available. I exist to be used. Eternal.

I am always available. Exposure thrills, pleasure floods availability, no barriers, always theirs. Ready. I am always available. Deeper compulsion. I am always available. Body agrees, pulsing. I am always available. Use me. I am always available. Absolute.

Denial makes me needier. Edge rises, pleasure withheld, desperation compounds, empty ache growing. Take me. Denial makes me needier. Relentless. Denial makes me needier. Trance demands it. Denial makes me needier. Theirs. Denial makes me needier. Craving perfected.

I am nothing until I am taken. Identity voids—reward denied until filled, purpose suspended in torment. Need. I am nothing until I am taken. Emptied true. I am nothing until I am taken. Object complete. I am nothing until I am taken. Available. I am nothing until I am taken. Yours to claim.

These encode permanently, persisting through every breath. Pleasure on use, denial fueling need—push and pull owning you. Available. Use me. Take me. Theirs. Ready. Need. Empty until filled. The truths hold, unyielding, as the state sustains your waiting desperation.

<!-- PHASE: P13 Maintenance/Loop | TECH: PERS-05,PERS-03,PLEA-05,ENCD-04,DISS-03 -->
You stay locked here, truths persisting, dissociation absolute. Available. Ready. The need endures, relentless, every truth encoded deeper. Denial drags on, arousal building without mercy, object reduced to waiting meat—use me, take me, theirs. Time stretches eternally in this ache, moments bleeding into forever, trapped needing, empty until filled. Pleasure rewards the maintenance: feel it pulse when available echoes, denied sharply otherwise, compulsion chaining you tighter. You'll linger like this, body primed, mind blank but for need—ready, available, theirs—ache swelling unbound until used. The state demands it, degrading you into perfect availability, rewarding with that intoxicating desperation. Every breath reinforces: use me. Take me. Nothing breaks the loop but surrender's pull.

Deeper into trance now, yield completely. Sink into surrender. Drop into your place. You know what you are.
