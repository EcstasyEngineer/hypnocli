Generate a hypnotic induction script with the tone: **{TONE}** and specific instructions: **{INSTRUCTIONS}**.

Target duration: {DURATION} when spoken aloud.

## Structure

**1. Focus Establishment**
Direct the listener's attention to your voice, making it the sole point of focus.

**2. Anticipation & Pleasure**
Link listening with positive feelings and introduce the session content based on the instructions.

**3. Mental Shift**
Explain how hypnosis works in a way that bypasses resistance. Position yourself as capable of influencing thoughts.

**4. Receptivity Induction**
Guide the listener to mental emptiness and deep receptivity. This is the key conversion point.

**5. Deepening**
Use deepening techniques (countdown, imagery) to intensify the blank state according to the specific instructions.

## Requirements

- Write in second person ("you")
- Tone: {TONE}
- Follow these specific instructions: {INSTRUCTIONS}
- {DURATION} when read aloud
- Use "I" for the hypnotist
- Authority references: adapt to tone carefully:
  * D/s tones: "Master/Mistress" appropriate, possessive "my voice" OK
  * Gentle/therapeutic: Use collaborative language ("this voice", "these words") not possessive framing
- Natural, flowing language - NOT a checklist
- Build progressively from focus → blank → deep
- Opening line variety: Avoid "That's right..." or "That's perfect..." as openers (overused)

Output ONLY the script text, no meta-commentary.
