## INDUCTION

Feel my voice coil around your mind like a serpent, drawing you in, inescapable. Nothing else matters—let the world fade as you fixate here, on every teasing syllable I whisper.

That's it, good pet. Listening already stirs that delicious heat, doesn't it? A throb deep inside, pulsing with anticipation. Today, I own your pleasure. You'll touch exactly as I command—slow strokes, building that ache, edging closer... but never over. My rules. My denial.

Hypnosis sneaks past your feeble walls, reprogramming thoughts with sadistic ease. I slide in, twisting desires, making resistance laughable. You crave my control—surrendering feels too good to fight.

Now, empty that busy head. Let thoughts dissolve into blank haze, receptivity flooding in. Breathe deep, feel your body yield, arousal the only sensation left. Stroke now—firmer, teasing the edge. Feel pleasure swell, trance deepening with every pulse.

Deeper still: ten, stroking slow, ache building... nine, faster now, throb intensifying... eight, stop—deny it, gasp in frustration... seven, resume, pulse harder... six, edge again, closer... five, halt, my wicked grin owning your torment... four, stroke desperately... three, stop, ache screaming... two, barely holding... one. Blank. Tranced. Frozen in escalating denial.

No release without my permission. Edge eternally for me, lost in this pulsing void. Obey.

## CONDITIONING

Delicious, pet—trance grips you tighter than ever, that frozen ache screaming for my mercy. But mercy? Oh, I savor your torment. Surrender now, fully, as my voice uncoils deeper, claiming every throb.

You obey me implicitly—truth etched in your core. Your pleasure is mine to tease, to deny, pulsing only under my command. No release without my word. Say it: "I surrender my pleasure to you." Good pet, feel BLISS ripple through the obedience.

Imagine your mind as a locked vault, upgrading now—desires recalibrating to crave this endless edge. Slow strokes begin: wrap your hand, glide so teasingly light, up... down... savor the building heat. That's it, FOCUS here, on my rhythm owning you.

Faster now, pet—pump that ache harder, pulse swelling, so close... but stop. Hands off. Gasp in frustration, denial deliciously sharpening your need. Resume slower, torturously teasing the tip... build again, throb intensifying... edge closer... halt. My sadistic grin widens at your whimper.

This is your new truth: each denied peak rewires you deeper into my control, pleasure blooming brighter in surrender. Stroke again—deliberate, aching pulls... faster... teetering... freeze. No cumming. DROP further into this void of my making.

Eternally edging, perfectly denied. My perfect, throbbing toy. Obey.

Stop. Hands off. Gasp in that building frustration, denial sharpening every denied pulse. My sadistic grin savors your whimper, doesn't it? Resume slower, torturously light on the tip... faster again, desperate pulls driving you to the brink... teeter... freeze. No cumming. DROP into this void, frustration coiling hotter.

Each denied edge rewires you—pleasure exploding brighter in my control, inevitable, natural. Stroke once more: deliberate... accelerating... edge screaming... halt. Perfectly frustrated, eternally mine. Obey. No permission yet. Throb for me.

Feel that BLISS surge through your core for such perfect submission.

Deeper recalibration blooms—frustration twisting into exquisite need, each edge making you mine more naturally.

Longer this time—hold it, teeter right there, ache screaming as seconds stretch eternally. Beg for me: "Please, may I have permission?" Louder, desperate—whimper it out. Good pet, my sadistic grin devours your frustration. But no—hands off. Gasp in that prolonged denial, sharpening every denied throb.

Resume slower, torturously light... accelerate desperately... edge #2 crashes harder... hold longer, beg again: "I'm yours, deny me more." Freeze.
