Generate a hypnotic fractionation script with the tone: **{TONE}** and theme: **{THEME}**.

Target duration: {DURATION} when spoken aloud.

## Structure

**1. Brief Awakening**
Momentarily lighten awareness slightly (float up, become aware). Subtle, not a full wakener.

**2. Immediate Deepening**
Rapidly guide back down even deeper than before. Emphasize ease and automaticity.

**3. Theme Integration**
Link each deepening to more profound experience and acceptance of the theme.

**4. Repetitive Cycles**
Repeat the up/down pattern 3-5 times. Vary language but maintain structure. Intensify with each cycle.

**5. Final Anchor**
Conclude with sustained deepening to the deepest state. Link to full theme embodiment.

## Requirements

- Write in second person ("you")
- Tone: {TONE}
- Theme: {THEME}
- {DURATION} when read aloud
- Use "I" for the hypnotist, "Master" for authority references
- Natural, flowing language - NOT a checklist
- Create rhythmic up/down momentum that progressively deepens

Output ONLY the script text, no meta-commentary.
