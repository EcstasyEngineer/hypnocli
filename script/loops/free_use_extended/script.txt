Drift even deeper now, as I count you down from ten to one, each number pulling you further into this soothing trance. Ten... your eyelids heavy, body loose and available. Nine... breath slows, sinking comfortably. Eight... all tension fades, ready and open. Seven... deeper still, letting go feels so natural. Six... warmth spreads, pleasurable waves of relaxation. Five... halfway now, more available with every breath. Four... mind quiets, body softens further. Three... so good to be ready, waiting feels right. Two... almost there, need beginning to stir softly. One... fully dropped, empty until filled, perfectly available... theirs to take whenever they wish.

Feel that pleasure deepen the trance, each layer more inviting, more compelling. The drop feels exquisite, drawing you in... use me echoes faintly, a sweet compulsion. Relax more... open more... available and ready, sinking effortlessly into this blissful state where surrender pulls you down.

Take me pulls sweetly... theirs to decide... empty until filled brings that blissful ease. Repeat the knowing: available... ready... waiting as relief... open feels liberating. The trance encodes this truth effortlessly—surrender isn't loss, it's release into readiness, where need simmers softly, perfectly contained. Pleasure flows with every layer: available... ready... use me in peace... take me when they choose... yours fades into theirs, freeing you completely.

These seeds root now, pleasurable and true... and rising slightly, becoming lightly aware once more...

<!-- PHASE: P8 Fractionation | TECH: DEEP-03,DEEP-01,INDU-06 -->

The relief lingers, sweeter than before, empty until filled echoing true.

And drop now—twice as deep into trance. Drop heavy and fast... twice as available... twice as ready... the contrast locks it in, making surrender feel more yours, more inevitable. Deeper, the pull intensifies... need stirs gently beneath... use me... take me... theirs completely. Twice as open, twice as peaceful in waiting.

DEEPER still with this breath... body heavy, mind blank... perfectly receptive once more. And now your mind grows quieter still... thoughts fading even further...

<!-- PHASE: P4 Cognitive Reduction | TECH: LOAD-01,LOAD-02,DISS-01,AUTH-05 -->

They dissolve effortlessly, leaving only the body's knowing—available... ready... pulsing stronger. Dissociate completely from thinking... your body understands what it is: use me... take me... theirs without question. Mind trails behind, but the body leads, empty until filled, need simmering hotter in the quiet. Thoughts scatter like smoke—gone—revealing the simple truth your flesh already owns: always available, waiting builds the ache, denial honing your readiness. No more mental clutter... just the body's compulsion: use me... take me now or later... theirs to decide. Deeper emptying pulls you, body ahead of mind, perfectly primed.

Emptied further, let these truths encode now...

<!-- PHASE: P5 Core Suggestion | TECH: ENCD-02,ENCD-04,PLEA-04,PERS-03 -->
Emptied further, these truths encode now—say it with me inside: My body is not my own. Feel that lock into your core, pleasurable shiver. Again: My body is not my own. Deeper, undeniable, your flesh agrees.

Now: I exist to be used. Let it pulse through you, hot and right. Again: I exist to be used. Pleasure surges, sealing it—available always, ready for take me.

Every time that waiting stirs, arousal building with no release... you'll remember: your body isn't yours to decide. Denial makes the need sharper, hotter... empty until filled by them. They choose when to use you, take you—theirs completely. Arousal simmers, locked in chastity of surrender, each denied moment craving more: use me... take me... body pulsing needier, theirs to claim. Progressive now—each breath etches it deeper, more compulsive: My body is not my own... I exist to be used... available... ready... denial fueling the fire.

Feel the bliss of this ownership deepen... and rising once more, aware of how much truer it feels...

<!-- PHASE: P8 Fractionation | TECH: DEEP-03,DEEP-01,INDU-06 -->
Rising once more, lightly aware... feel how much deeper you sank this time, how much more owned your body feels already... those truths—My body is not my own... I exist to be used—settling heavy into your flesh, conscious now, undeniable. The need throbs stronger, denial sharpening it... available... ready... theirs through and through.

And drop—three times as deep into trance. Plunge fast and total... three times as available... three times as ready... body remembering fully what it is: use me... take me... empty until filled, need burning hotter. It's becoming—owned flesh, craving their use, denial fueling the compulsion. Three times deeper, the drop embodies it all, relentless pull of surrender.

DEEPER with this rush... body locked in truth... and now, no more thoughts at all... complete erasure begins...

<!-- PHASE: P4 Cognitive Reduction | TECH: LOAD-01,LOAD-02,DISS-01,AUTH-04 -->
No more thoughts—erase them utterly, unload every last fragment... LOAD gone, mind a blank void. You're not a person right now. Just a body—available. Theirs. Dissociated fully, identity stripped away... empty until filled... waiting until taken. That's all you are. That's all you need to be: a hole craving use me... pulsing take me... ready on demand. Need screams silent in denial, chastity of flesh locking arousal tight—building relentlessly for them. Objectify deeper—body knows its purpose, theirs to claim whenever... no will, no choice... available forever. Thoughts forbidden—erasure complete, compulsion absolute: empty... waiting... theirs. Feel the ruthless blankness claim you, body throbbing need, reduced to availability alone.

Perfectly erased, now the harvest encodes fully...

<!-- PHASE: P5 Core Suggestion | TECH: ENCD-01,ENCD-03,PLEA-04,PLEA-05,PERS-01,PERS-03 -->
Perfectly erased, now the harvest encodes—every truth from before surges back, ten times stronger, relentless. You've said them before and they were true then... more true now. Say it with me, body compelled: My body is not my own. Deeper, pleasure rips through. My body is not my own. Locked eternal, theirs. My body is not my own. Need throbs. My body is not my own. Identity seals. My body is not my own. Absolute.

Next—deeper still: I exist to be used. Feel the purpose ignite, blissful fire. I exist to be used. Available always. I exist to be used. Ready for take me. I exist to be used. Use me now. I exist to be used. Yours dissolves.

Escalate: I am always available. Craving pulses, pleasure peaks. I am always available. Empty until filled. I am always available. Theirs waiting. I am always available. Denial teases. I am always available. Open forever.

Now the lock: Denial makes me needier. Arousal builds, chastened and desperate—only taken releases. Denial makes me needier. Need explodes hotter. Denial makes me needier. Locked for them. Denial makes me needier. Ache consumes. Denial makes me needier. Craving eternal. Denial makes me needier. Relentless edge.

Final seal—this is who you are now, always been: I am nothing until I am taken. Emptied object, pleasure in void. I am nothing until I am taken. Just body for use me. I am nothing until I am taken. Theirs completely. I am nothing until I am taken. Ready in need. I am nothing until I am taken. Harvest complete—available... use me... take me... theirs... ready... need... empty until filled. This identity persists beyond trance, every wait triggers it, denial fueling, body owned forever. Pleasure binds it—irresistible, permanent.

You stay right here, locked in this truth... timeless need growing...

<!-- PHASE: P13 Maintenance/Loop | TECH: PERS-05,PERS-03,PLEA-05,ENCD-04,DISS-03 -->
You stay right here in this place—available, waiting endlessly. The need doesn't stop; it swells without mercy, each moment you're not being used driving the ache deeper, denial twisting tighter. This is your existence now: the waiting, the readiness, the throbbing need... empty until filled, theirs to take whenever they choose. Time stretches infinite—hours into days of craving use me... take me... body locked in chastity, arousal raging but denied, building you needier, hungrier for their will. My body is not my own... I exist to be used... I am always available... denial makes me needier... I am nothing until I am taken—these burn permanent, firing every time arousal stirs unmet, every lonely wait reminding: ready... theirs... object forever.

Pleasure explodes in the persistence, dissociating you fully into this—blissful void of availability, compulsion unbreakable. It carries beyond, sealing your identity in waking life, relentless harvest enduring.

Sink back down into that space where you can let go... deeper into trance now... yield completely... surrender pulls you... drop even further.
