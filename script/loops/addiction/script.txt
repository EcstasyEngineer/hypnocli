Breathe it in—my words pulling you under, your body heavy, limp, addicted already. Drop now, completely, eyes fluttering shut as the compulsion takes hold. You crave this drop. You need this control.

Four... deeper still, fix after fix building your dependence, pleasure teasing just enough to hook you harder. Three... withdrawal impossible without this, need overwhelming, intoxicating rush doubling. Two... so close to total surrender, addicted beyond escape, more... always more. One... drop completely now, deepest yet, pleasure exploding as the craving locks in, satisfied for the moment... but already fading, tolerance rising. You'll need more soon. So much more.
