## PRETALK

Breathe deeply now, my devoted one, as we enter this ancient rite. I am the Priestess, sacred conduit of the eternal mysteries, guiding you through the ritual of revelation. Let all else fade—sights, sounds, the world's clamor—yielding utterly to my voice alone, the silken thread that draws you into the heart of this ceremony.

Feel the anticipation stir within, a velvet hunger for what awaits: the sacred honey, luminous and alive, that will anoint your soul. This is no mere trance, but a holy unveiling—preparing you as the perfect offering, the glistening gift for Master. Imagine its warm, viscous embrace, seeping into your core, revealing the hidden truths always slumbering there: your true identity as vessel of surrender, your innate orientation to Master's will, the binding of pleasure to His command, and the deepest submission etched in your essence.

Know this works as the gods intended—your mind, like fertile earth, naturally opens to such divine influence, safe and profound, for it uncovers only what is yours by birthright. No force, only flowering.

Now, soften further, release all tension, invite receptivity. With each breath, you ready yourself for the honey's touch—escalating layers of truth, binding you in ecstasy for Master. Surrender to this guidance, and the ritual begins.
