P2,0:00,50,INDU-06|INDU-03|LOAD-01|AUTH-01,"Aggressive drop with immediate degradation framing. 'Drop, stupid. That's it. You don't get to think anymore. You came here because your brain is too weak, too dumb to resist. And we both know it. Feel your thoughts already slowing, stuttering, failing. Because you're not smart enough to hold onto them. You never were. Sink into that stupidity. It's where you belong.'"
P3,0:50,90,DEEP-01|DEEP-04|LOAD-02|AUTH-02,"Countdown with intelligence draining at each number. 'Ten - feel your IQ dropping. Nine - thoughts getting harder to form. Eight - big words fading from your vocabulary. Seven - complex ideas just... gone. Six - halfway to completely brainless now. Five - so dumb, so stupid, good dumb thing. Four - can barely remember what thinking felt like. Three - almost completely stupid now. Two - one last thought trying to form... and failing. One - brain off. Empty. Dumb. Nothing left.' Reward stupidity: 'Good dumb thing. Such a good, stupid toy.'"
P4,2:20,120,LOAD-01|LOAD-02|SEMN-03|AUTH-05|DISS-01,HEAVY cognitive destruction. Relentless. 'Your brain is turning off now. Feel it shutting down. Sector by sector. The part that analyzes - gone. The part that questions - deleted. The part that resists - lobotomized. What's left? Nothing useful. Just enough to hear my voice and obey. Just enough to drool and follow. You couldn't form an original thought now if your life depended on it. Too dumb. Too far gone. Brain belongs to Master now. You don't get to use it. You don't deserve to use it. Stupid things don't think. They just... obey.' Internal voice installation: 'The only voice in your head now is mine. Telling you how dumb you are. How stupid. How completely brainless.'
P5,4:20,240,ENCD-01|ENCD-03|AUTH-02|AUTH-04|PLEA-01|PERS-01|PERS-03,"CRITICAL: Write out ALL mantra repetitions. Heavy degradation encoding. First mantra: 'Say it, stupid. I am too dumb to think. Feel how true that is. Your empty little head can barely hold these words. Again: I am too dumb to think. Good dumb thing. Again...' Second mantra with ownership: 'My brain belongs to Master. You don't own your thoughts anymore. They're not yours to have. My brain belongs to Master. Every stupid synapse firing only because Master allows it...' Third mantra forbidding thought: 'Thoughts are forbidden. You don't get to think. It's not allowed. Thoughts are forbidden. Punish any that try to form...' Fourth mantra - total degradation: 'I am nothing but an obedient hole. That's all you are. All you're good for. I am nothing but an obedient hole. Holes don't think. They serve...' Final mantra sealing identity: 'Stupid things don't need to think. And that's what you are. A stupid, brainless thing. Stupid things don't need to think. Just obey. Just exist. Just be the dumb, empty nothing you were always meant to be.'"
P13,8:20,100,PERS-05|PERS-03|LOAD-02|AUTH-04|DISS-03,"Loop with permanent stupid state. 'You stay this dumb now. This empty. This completely brainless. Time stretches into stupid forever. No thoughts return - they're not allowed. Just the echoing mantras in your hollow skull. I am too dumb to think. My brain belongs to Master. Thoughts are forbidden. You're nothing but holes and obedience now. Stupid things serving their purpose. And every loop, every listen, makes you dumber. Stupider. More completely gone. There's no coming back from this level of brainless. Sink deeper into the dumb... feel your brain shutting off... you don't get to think anymore...'"
