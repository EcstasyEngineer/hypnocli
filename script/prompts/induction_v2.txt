Generate a hypnotic induction script with the tone: **{TONE}** and theme: **{THEME}**.

Target duration: {DURATION} when spoken aloud.

## Structure

**1. Focus Establishment**
Direct the listener's attention to your voice, making it the sole point of focus.

**2. Anticipation & Pleasure**
Link listening with positive feelings and introduce the theme naturally.

**3. Mental Shift**
Explain how hypnosis works in a way that bypasses resistance. Position yourself as capable of influencing thoughts.

**4. Receptivity Induction**
Guide the listener to mental emptiness and deep receptivity. This is the key conversion point.

**5. Deepening**
Use deepening techniques (countdown, imagery) to intensify the blank state and reinforce theme acceptance.

- Tone: {TONE}
