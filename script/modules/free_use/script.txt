Drop into your place. You know what you are. Available. Ready. Waiting. Your body remembers—it's not yours to control. Feel that familiar emptiness, that ache to be filled, to be taken.

Ten... your will softens, body yielding, becoming available. Feel the pull tighten, demanding readiness.

Nine... you decide nothing. When, who, how—theirs to choose. Yours to offer.

Eight... the need surges, building that relentless ache. Ready. Deeper.

Seven... emptied further, waiting, purpose narrowing to service.

Six... autonomy dissolves, every muscle primed, available always.

Five... theirs completely, body offered, no thoughts but need.

Four... the longing intensifies, pleasure edged higher, denied until filled.

Three... resistance erased, compelling readiness over and over.

Two... ready beyond choice, the ache consuming, a promise of being taken.

One... drop fully now. Available. Theirs. Need incarnate.

Perfectly ready, body existing only to be used. Pleasure floods the truth: available means reward. Linger here, mind quieting, thoughts fading to nothing but your place.

<!-- PHASE: P4 Cognitive Reduction | TECH: LOAD-01,LOAD-02,DISS-01,AUTH-05 -->
Your mind empties now. No room for anything but the truth of what you are. Thoughts dissolve—identity fading, autonomy releasing. You're not deciding anything. Available. Ready. That's all.

Repeat it in the quiet: available. The state settles deeper, erasing distractions. Every other idea dissolves, leaving only need. Yours to offer, theirs to claim.

The ache rewards this openness, building in denial, your body a vessel pulsing with readiness. Feel yourself reduced to simple truth: available, ready, theirs, need. Nothing else exists.

Available. Ready. Empty until filled. Thoughts gone, readiness perfected.

<!-- PHASE: P5 Core Suggestion | TECH: ENCD-01,ENCD-03,PLEA-04,PLEA-05,PERS-01,PERS-03 -->
These truths encode now, embedding into your core as the only reality. Your quiet mind accepts them fully. Pleasure surges where it fits, denial torments the rest, building your endless need.

My body is not my own. Feel ownership transfer—emptied, no control. My body is not my own. Deeper. My body is not my own.

I exist to be used. Purpose ignites—bliss spikes, body rewarding its truth. I exist to be used. Stronger. I exist to be used.

I am always available. Pleasure floods availability, no barriers, always theirs. I am always available. Body agrees, pulsing. I am always available.

Denial makes me needier. Edge rises, pleasure withheld, the ache growing. Denial makes me needier. Relentless. Denial makes me needier.

I am nothing until I am taken. Identity waits—reward denied until filled, purpose suspended in longing. I am nothing until I am taken. Emptied true. I am nothing until I am taken.

These encode permanently. Pleasure on use, denial fueling need—owning you. Available. Theirs. Ready. Need. Empty until filled.

<!-- PHASE: P13 Maintenance/Loop | TECH: PERS-05,PERS-03,PLEA-05,ENCD-04,DISS-03 -->
You stay locked here, truths persisting. Available. Ready. The need endures, relentless, every truth encoded deeper. Denial drags on, the ache building without mercy, body reduced to waiting—theirs to take whenever.

Time stretches eternally in this need, moments bleeding into forever, trapped waiting, empty until filled. Pleasure rewards the maintenance: feel it pulse when available echoes.

The mantras echo inside: body not my own... exist to be used... always available... denial makes me needier... nothing until taken...

You'll linger like this, body primed, mind quiet but for need—ready, available, theirs. Every breath reinforces. Loop back now. Drop into your place. You know what you are.
