Generate a hypnotic conditioning script with the tone: **{TONE}** and specific instructions: **{INSTRUCTIONS}**.

Target duration: {DURATION} when spoken aloud.

## Structure

**1. Direct Commands**
State the desired beliefs and behaviors as undeniable truths using strong present-tense affirmations. Follow the specific instructions exactly.

**2. Pleasure Linking**
Associate acceptance with positive feelings and rewards. Build anticipation for benefits as specified in the instructions.

**3. Transformation Metaphors**
Use metaphors that make conditioning feel natural and empowering (upgrading, recalibrating, growing).

**4. Implicit Suggestions**
Embed suggestions that presuppose the listener already desires what's described in the instructions. Make it feel inevitable.

**5. Repetitive Reinforcement**
Layer the core content throughout using varied phrasing and associations for deep implantation. Follow the instructions precisely.

## Requirements

- Write in second person ("you")
- Tone: {TONE}
- Follow these specific instructions: {INSTRUCTIONS}
- {DURATION} when read aloud
- Use "I" for the hypnotist
- Authority references: adapt to tone carefully:
  * D/s tones: "Master/Mistress" appropriate, possessive "my voice" OK
  * Gentle/therapeutic: Use collaborative language ("this voice", "these words", "we") not possessive framing
- Natural, flowing language - NOT a checklist
- Build cumulative conditioning effect
- IMPORTANT: Implement exactly what the instructions specify using concrete techniques:
  * JOI/stroking: Include specific rhythm/speed commands ("stroke slowly... faster now... hold")
  * Call-and-response: Make the listener respond ("Say 'I obey'... repeat after me...")
  * Training exercises: Give specific tasks ("clench and release... count with me...")
  * Multiple conditioning segments: VARY the approach substantially each time
- Trigger word discipline: Use BLISS/DROP/FOCUS sparingly (max 2-3 per segment). They lose impact through overuse.
- METAPHOR VARIATION: When multiple conditioning segments exist, establish ONE signature metaphor
  per segment. Carry forward ANCHORS/TRIGGERS but vary decorative metaphors across segments.
  (e.g., "serpent voice" in one → "velvet grip" in next → "silk thread" in another)

Output ONLY the script text, no meta-commentary.
