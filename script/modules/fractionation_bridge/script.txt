<!-- PHASE: P8 Fractionation | TECH: DEEP-03,VALD-04,INDU-06 -->
Rising now... just a little... becoming aware of your body again... the weight of your limbs... the sounds around you fading back in... But notice something. Notice how foggy your thoughts still are. How heavy you feel. How deep you sank without even realizing. That depth is still there, waiting... teasing you with how far you dropped so easily...

And now...

Drop.

Drop twice as deep. Plunge back down, faster than before, heavier, deeper. Twice as gone. Twice as blank. Twice as surrendered. Sink now, sink deeper into that proven trance, the pull demanding you fall harder, faster, twice the surrender. Notice how instantly you obey, how the rise only proves your depth, locking it in stronger. You're so much deeper already... so ready to drop even further.

<!-- PHASE: P8 Fractionation | TECH: DEEP-03,DEEP-01,VALD-04 -->
Rising again... lighter this time... more aware... Notice how much deeper you sank on that last drop. Twice as deep, twice as easy to fall. Notice how natural it feels now, the pull to sink growing stronger, your mind learning with every rise and drop. Every cycle trains you deeper, proves how helplessly you surrender. You know exactly what's coming... the anticipation building, teasing your readiness...

Drop.

Three times as deep. Plunge now, let go completely, surrender absolutely. Fall so far down you'll forget you were ever awake. Drop deeper, sink faster, three times heavier, three times blanker, three times surrendered to the trance. Notice the control—how instantly you obey, how profound this depth has become. Sink into it fully... locked twice as susceptible, ready for more.

<!-- PHASE: P4 Cognitive Reduction | TECH: LOAD-02,DEEP-05,VALD-04 -->
Feel where you are now. So much deeper than before. Twice as open, twice as surrendered. Notice the fractionation's training—your mind drops instantly now, sinks on the command to sink, blanks at the pull of blank. This depth, so proven, so heavy, is your baseline. No more rises teasing awareness, only endless drops deeper. Sink into it completely, locked and ready. Empty. Perfectly prepared, so much more susceptible... holding steady as it all continues.

<!-- PHASE: P13 Maintenance/Loop | TECH: PERS-03,DEEP-05 -->
Stay in this depth. Let it hold you. Notice how profoundly deeper you've sunk—no rise, only drops twice as easy. You're so ready, so blank, completely surrendered. The next module flows in now... sink even deeper into it.
