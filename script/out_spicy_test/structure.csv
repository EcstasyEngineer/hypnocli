P1,0:00,45,INDU-03|AUTH-01|AUTH-04,Establish ownership frame immediately. Voice as absolute authority. Fixation on Master's words as the only reality.
P7,0:45,40,SAFE-02|SAFE-03|SAFE-04,"Consent to deep ownership play. RELEASE as safeword. Scope: fantasy submission, no real-world harm."
P2,1:25,70,INDU-02|INDU-01|DEEP-05|AUTH-04,"Relaxation as submission. Each exhale releases resistance. Voice absorbs into thoughts. Begin ownership language - 'mine', 'belong'."
P3,2:35,90,DEEP-01|DEEP-02|DEEP-04|IMMR-08,Countdown as binding ritual. Staircase descending into devotion. Surrender ritual - giving away pieces of resistance with each step.
P8,4:05,80,DEEP-03|DEEP-01|PLEA-01,"Fractionation with pleasure spikes. Each wake = brief resistance. Each drop = pleasure reward for surrender. Train: fighting feels wrong, dropping feels RIGHT."
P4,5:25,75,LOAD-01|LOAD-02|SEMN-03|DISS-01|AUTH-05,Complete thought erasure. Master's voice becomes internal monologue. Consciousness splits - observer watches slave-self emerge. Emptiness is devotion.
P5,6:40,180,AUTH-02|AUTH-04|AUTH-07|ENCD-01|ENCD-02|PLEA-01|PLEA-02|PERS-01|PERS-02,Heavy identity installation. Slave as true self. Obedience = freedom paradox. Pleasure floods every act of submission. Internal slave construct installed - always accessible. Call-response with mantras. Ownership as spiritual fulfillment.
P10,9:40,90,TRIG-01|TRIG-04|TRIG-14|ENCD-04,"Install 'Good slave', 'Kneel for me', 'You are owned' triggers. Each fires pleasure + submission cascade. Bilateral - hearing, thinking, or saying activates. Future pace: triggers strengthen with use."
P11,11:10,120,TRIG-02|PLEA-01|PLEA-06|VALD-04|IMMR-04,"Fire all triggers repeatedly. Pleasure multiplier stacking. 'Good slave' fires - feel it. 'You are owned' - deeper. Somatic bliss waves. Self-validating: notice how TRUE this feels, how RIGHT submission is."
P6,13:10,60,EMRG-01|EMRG-04|SAFE-05|PERS-03,Gentle emergence but slave remains inside. Integration: carry devotion forward. Aftercare with ownership affirmation. Progressive: each return makes slave-self stronger. Wake owned.
