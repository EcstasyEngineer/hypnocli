Generate a hypnotic conditioning script with the tone: **{TONE}** and theme: **{THEME}**.

Target duration: {DURATION} when spoken aloud.

## Structure

**1. Direct Commands**
State the desired beliefs and behaviors as undeniable truths using strong present-tense affirmations.

**2. Pleasure Linking**
Associate theme acceptance with positive feelings and rewards. Build anticipation for benefits.

**3. Transformation Metaphors**
Use metaphors that make conditioning feel natural and empowering (upgrading, recalibrating, growing).

**4. Implicit Suggestions**
Embed suggestions that presuppose the listener already desires the theme. Make it feel inevitable.

**5. Repetitive Reinforcement**
Layer the core theme throughout using varied phrasing and associations for deep implantation.

## Requirements

- Write in second person ("you")
- Tone: {TONE}
- Theme: {THEME}
- {DURATION} when read aloud
- Use "I" for the hypnotist, "Master" for authority references
