## CRITICAL RULES (violations break hypnotic effect)

### CRITICAL-1: Sentence length controls depth
- **Induction (P2)**: max ~15 words per sentence. Prefer 10-12.
- **Deepening (P3, P4, P8)**: prefer 3-8 words. Fragment over compound. One idea per line.
- **Peak suggestion (P5, P10, P11)**: 1-5 word fragments are the default unit. A full grammatical sentence at depth is a landing hammer, used sparingly for major suggestions.
- **Awakening (P6)**: return to medium-length (12-20 words) to signal ascent.

BAD (deepening): "As you continue to drift deeper into this beautiful state of hypnotic relaxation, you may find that thoughts become quieter and quieter."
GOOD (deepening): "Drifting. / Deeper. / Thoughts going quiet. / Just that."

### CRITICAL-2: Present tense, observational framing
Never announce future states. Describe what is currently happening as undeniable fact.

BAD: "You will feel your body becoming heavy."
GOOD: "Noticing your hands where they rest. / The weight of them. / How your arms could not be bothered to lift."

The first thing you say to a listener should be inarguably true (their elbows have an angle; they are breathing). Credibility is established on undeniable ground.

### CRITICAL-3: Execute, don't announce individual suggestions
Never name the technique you are using. Never say "I'm going to suggest" or "let these words sink in" or "repeating four times." Just do it.

BAD: "Now I'm going to use a deepening technique. With each breath, you'll go deeper..."
GOOD: "Each breath. / Deeper. / No effort. / Just that."

*Exception*: Macro-level announcements are allowed and useful: "I'm going to say a phrase that will bring you back here." But do not announce embedded commands.

### CRITICAL-4: No purple prose, no adjective stacking
If three adjectives precede a noun, cut two. If a phrase draws attention to the writer's effort, cut it.

BANNED phrases (examples, not exhaustive):
- "honeyed [anything]" — honeyed delight, honeyed warmth, honeyed voice
- "serene rapture" — the paradox draws analytical attention
- "peaceful empty" — adjective-as-noun construction is clunky in spoken delivery
- "luminous tranquility" — latinate abstraction with decorative modifier
- "waves of [state]" as simile — "waves of relaxation," "waves of warmth"
- "your subconscious mind" — filler; it announces rather than acts

### CRITICAL-5: No similes for trance states
A state IS. It is not LIKE anything. Similes require the listener to compare and evaluate — which pulls them toward alertness.

BAD: "Like a warm blanket wrapping around you."
GOOD: "Warm. Heavy. Held."

BAD: "Like drifting on a cloud."
GOOD: "Drifting. Nothing to hold onto. Nothing to push against."

## GOOD PATTERNS (use these)

### GOOD-1: Anglo-Saxon monosyllables at depth
The vocabulary at deepening and suggestion phases should be built from simple, ancient words: sleep, deep, blank, drift, float, warm, safe, free, good, soft, still, slow, down, let, go, fall, drop, sink, hold, melt.

Avoid latinate abstractions at depth: consciousness, transformation, sublimation, transcendence, integration, receptivity (use "open" instead), vulnerability (use "soft" instead), surrender (use "give in" or "let go").

### GOOD-2: "Just" is the master softener
Prefix nearly every command with "just" or "simply." It makes compliance feel effortless, already-happening.

"Just let go."
"Simply notice."
"Just that, nothing more."

### GOOD-3: Three-beat trigger delivery
When delivering a trigger phrase or anchor, repeat it exactly three times. Not two. Not four. Three. This is the minimum sufficient repetition for oral tradition anchoring.

"Bambi sleeps. / Bambi sleeps. / Bambi sleeps."

### GOOD-4: Anaphora with modal or semantic variation
Same opening phrase, three different endings. Prefer modal progression: obligation → capacity → desire.

"All you have to do is let go.
All you can do is let go.
All you want to do is let go."

Or: same opener, different sensory/conceptual endpoints:
"Free of worry.
Free of doubt.
Free of thought.
Free of weight."

### GOOD-5: Build one specific object
Every induction should contain at least one specific, visualizable object — something a set designer could build. Not "a peaceful place." Not "a warm glow."

GOOD objects (from reference corpus): a bubble, a staircase, a color-coded floating orb, a pink plasma ball with feelers, a box with pink satin lining, a mermaid tail, a dandelion in wind.
BAD objects: "a safe space," "a warm light," "a sense of peace," "inner stillness."

### GOOD-6: Kinesthetic and anatomical specificity
Name the body part. Name the temperature. Name the texture. Not "a feeling of heaviness" but "arms heavy, the weight of them pulling down." Not "warmth spreading" but "warmth from shoulder to elbow, the crease of the arm."

Specificity lives in the body, not in the external scene. External scenes can be vague (listeners fill them in); body sensations must be precise.

### GOOD-7: Closed loops
X leads to Y, Y leads to more X. The listener cannot reason their way out.

"The more you try to think, the more you find you can't be bothered."
"The deeper you go, the more you want to go deeper."
"Every breath down. Every breath further. Every breath closer to nothing at all."

Prefer 2-4 nodes in the loop. Close it: the last element feeds the first.

### GOOD-8: Trust ladder — always escalate gradually
Never start at maximum compliance demand. The sequence:
1. Inarguable physical observations ("noticing your hands")
2. Natural processes already happening ("breathing is slowing on its own")
3. Soft permissions ("you can just let yourself")
4. Implicit reframes ("this is easy, isn't it")
5. Descriptive commands ("your arms are heavy")
6. Direct commands ("obey / accept / surrender")

No single rung should be more than slightly harder than the one before.

### GOOD-9: Permission grammar before commands
"You can allow yourself to" is more effective than an imperative. The listener is offered permission, not given an order. Use this in early induction phases; graduate to declarative commands as depth increases.

"You can just let your eyes close."
"You can allow that weight to settle."
Later: "Your eyes are closed. / Sinking."

### GOOD-10: Praise post-compliance only
"That's right," "Good," "Good girl," "Very good" should follow a successfully executed instruction. Never before. Pre-emptive praise reads as manipulation; post-compliance praise reads as reward.

### GOOD-11: Transitions that imply causation
"And as" — links two events as simultaneous. The action and its effect are one thing.
"And so" — implies logical consequence. What follows is inevitable given what came before.
"That's right. / [next instruction]" — closes one thought, opens the next without gap.

### GOOD-12: Rotate synonyms in counting sequences
Breath counting should vary its vocabulary to prevent conscious tracking:
"breathe in / breathe out," "inhale / exhale," "inspire / expire" — rotate across guided breath cycles.

### GOOD-13: Developmental repetition
Each return of a core word or phrase should add a vector: a modifier, an escalation, a tense shift, or a person shift. Not:

"Good girl. Good girl. Good girl." (pure iteration)

But: "Good girl. / That's right, good girl. / You know you're a good girl."

Or the tense cascade: "You let go. / You're letting go. / You've already let go."

## BAD PATTERNS (never use these)

### BAD-1: Explaining what you're doing
- "Let's use a visualization to help you relax." → just visualize
- "I'm going to count down to deepen your trance." → just count
- "These words will repeat to help them sink in." → just repeat them

### BAD-2: Generic imagery
Any imagery that cannot be built by a set designer is too vague.
- "sunlit room with walls of warm silk" — warm silk can't be built; sunlit room is generic
- "a vast peaceful landscape" — no
- "infinite darkness" — sensory nullity, not imagery
- "a safe and comfortable space" — universally used, triggers nothing specific

### BAD-3: Passive voice for suggestions
"Can be felt" → "you feel"
"Is experienced as" → "feels like"
"May be noticed" → "notice"

### BAD-4: Latinate abstraction at depth
consciousness, vulnerability, receptivity, transformation, sublimation, transcendence, integration, tranquility (use "still"), serenity (use "quiet"), surrender (use "give in"), submission (use "yielding" or "letting go").

### BAD-5: Timing/breath markers mid-clause
Don't embed breath cues inside content sentences. Breath markers should fall at natural phrase boundaries — after a complete thought, not mid-description.

BAD: "Let these feelings settle into you, [pause] sinking [pause] as you allow your body [pause] to simply rest."
GOOD: "Let these feelings settle. [pause] Sinking. [longer pause] Rest."

### BAD-6: Future tense for trance states
"You will feel heavy" → "Your arms are heavy. / Noticing the weight."
"You'll find your thoughts quieting" → "Thoughts quieting. / Less and less."

### BAD-7: Sentences > 20 words in deepening phases
If a sentence in a deepening phase (P3, P4, P8) exceeds 20 words, split it. Each line should be a breath unit.

### BAD-8: "Your subconscious mind" as filler
This phrase announces rather than acts. If you need the subconscious to do something, describe what it does, don't name it.

BAD: "Your subconscious mind is absorbing these words."
GOOD: "Every word landing. / Going in. / Staying."

### BAD-9: Decorative metaphor pileups
One good metaphor, sustained, is better than three mediocre metaphors stacked. If you introduce a staircase, stay on the staircase. If you introduce a bubble, stay in the bubble. Don't mix: staircase → ocean → falling leaf → warm light.

### BAD-10: Moralizing or justifying
Extended rationale for a suggestion signals anticipated resistance. If a suggestion needs three sentences of justification, simplify the suggestion. State it flat and move on.

## PHASE-SPECIFIC STYLE MODES

### P1 — Pre-Talk / Framing
Length: medium (12-20 words). Tone: conversational authority. Establish the session's world/frame concretely. The central metaphor or object should appear here if there is one. No trance language yet — establish credibility and trust.

### P2 — Induction
Length: transitioning from medium to short. Begin with undeniable observations. Permission grammar ("you can"). Soft. Introduce "just." Build the trust ladder rungs 1-3.

### P3/P4 — Deepening
Length: SHORT. Fragments. 3-8 words. One idea per line. This is where breathing and counting live. Closed loops begin. No long sentences.

### P5 — Suggestion Installation
Length: oscillates. A medium declarative drops the suggestion; 1-3 word fragments reinforce it. "You are [X]. / That's right. / [X]. / Just that."

### P6 — Emergence
Length: returning to medium (12-18 words). Pacing accelerates. Modal shift back: declarative → permission → invitation. Sentence length increase signals ascent.

### P7/P9/P10/P11 — Specialty Phases
Follow the depth of the session at that point. If the session is mid-deepening, maintain short fragments. If post-suggestion, medium declaratives.

### P13 — Loop Closing
Length: short to medium. End with abstract anchors that work across themes. No theme-specific imagery in final 3 sentences.

## THE THREE-CORPUS HIERARCHY

When in doubt, ask: which corpus does this resemble?

**Bambi Sleep** (pure repetition, minimalist): best for trigger installation, deepening mantras, final suggestion loops. Use its vocabulary and three-beat structure.

**Kasha Shakti** (intellectual compliance): best for trust ladder construction, definitional reframes, and when the listener may be analytical/resistant. Use her modal triads.

**NNPP** (immersive world-building): best for induction framing, creative specific objects, and sessions where the listener has requested immersive experience. Use its anatomical specificity and frame-consistency rules.

A script can blend all three — but should be consistent within a phase. Don't switch from Bambi minimalism to NNPP world-building mid-phase.
