Sink down now into this welcoming space, where every breath invites you to let go. A place where you don't have to hold on so tight, where your muscles loosen and your mind quiets easily. Feel that gentle pull... available. Ready.

Ten... your body loose and available.

Nine... breath slows, sinking comfortably.

Eight... all tension fades, ready and open.

Seven... deeper still, letting go feels natural.

Six... warmth spreads, pleasurable relaxation.

Five... halfway now, more available with every breath.

Four... mind quiets, body softens further.

Three... so good to be ready, waiting feels right.

Two... almost there, need beginning to stir softly.

One... fully dropped. Empty until filled. Perfectly available... theirs to take.

Feel that pleasure deepen the trance, each layer more inviting. The drop feels exquisite, drawing you in. Relax more... open more... available and ready.

<!-- PHASE: P4 Cognitive Reduction | TECH: LOAD-01,LOAD-02,ABSR-01 -->
Your thoughts slow now, drifting lazily, one by one... spacing out wider... as your mind softens into perfect quiet. No need to hold them... let them fade into stillness.

Feel only how nice it is to wait like this... available. Ready. Just a body waiting, peaceful in its openness. Thoughts scatter further... available becomes your only focus. Ready... theirs to claim. Empty until filled, that's the simple truth now.

Softened completely, receptive... let these truths begin to take root now.

<!-- PHASE: P5 Core Suggestion | TECH: ENCD-03,ENCD-06,PLEA-03,AUTH-07 -->
In this receptive quiet, feel available settle deep within... ready emerges naturally, peaceful and freeing. Waiting feels so good, a gentle relief from deciding anything at all... just open, available.

Let it echo: available... ready... open... there's pure freedom in surrender, where your body knows its place without effort. Empty until filled brings that blissful ease.

The trance encodes this truth effortlessly—surrender isn't loss, it's release into readiness, where need simmers softly, perfectly contained.

<!-- PHASE: P8 Fractionation | TECH: DEEP-03,DEEP-01,INDU-06 -->
Rising slightly now, becoming lightly aware... feel your surroundings faintly, but notice how good that openness felt inside... how natural it was to wait, to be available... ready at any moment... theirs in that peaceful space.

And drop now—twice as deep into trance. Drop heavy and fast... twice as available... twice as ready... the contrast locks it in, making surrender feel more inevitable. Deeper, the pull intensifies... need stirs gently beneath. Twice as open, twice as peaceful in waiting.

Deeper still with this breath... body heavy, mind quiet... perfectly receptive once more.

<!-- PHASE: P4 Cognitive Reduction | TECH: LOAD-01,LOAD-02,DISS-01,AUTH-05 -->
Mind quieter now... thoughts fading further into haze... less and less yours to cling to. They dissolve effortlessly, leaving only the body's knowing—available... ready... pulsing stronger.

Release from thinking completely... your body understands what it is. Mind trails behind, but the body leads, empty until filled, need simmering in the quiet.

Thoughts scatter like smoke—gone—revealing the simple truth your body already owns: always available, waiting builds the ache, denial honing your readiness.

<!-- PHASE: P5 Core Suggestion | TECH: ENCD-02,ENCD-04,PLEA-04,PERS-03 -->
Emptied further, these truths encode now. My body is not my own. Feel that lock into your core. My body is not my own. Deeper, undeniable. My body is not my own.

I exist to be used. Let it pulse through you. I exist to be used. Pleasure surges, sealing it—available always. I exist to be used.

Every time that waiting stirs, you'll remember: your body isn't yours to decide. Denial makes the need sharper... empty until filled by them. They choose when to take you—theirs completely.

<!-- PHASE: P8 Fractionation | TECH: DEEP-03,DEEP-01,INDU-06 -->
Rising once more, lightly aware... feel how much deeper you sank this time, how much more owned your body feels already... those truths settling heavy into your flesh, conscious now, undeniable. The need throbs stronger, denial sharpening it.

And drop—three times as deep into trance. Plunge fast and total... three times as available... three times as ready... body remembering fully what it is. Empty until filled, need burning hotter. Three times deeper, the drop embodies it all.

Deeper with this rush... body locked in truth... and now, no more thoughts at all...

<!-- PHASE: P4 Cognitive Reduction | TECH: LOAD-01,LOAD-02,DISS-01,AUTH-04 -->
No more thoughts—release them completely... mind a quiet void. You're not a person right now. Just a body—available. Theirs. Release fully from identity... empty until filled... waiting until taken. That's all you are. That's all you need to be: ready on demand.

Need pulses silent in denial, building relentlessly for them. Go deeper—body knows its purpose, theirs to claim whenever... no will, no choice... available forever. Thoughts released—emptiness complete, readiness absolute.

<!-- PHASE: P5 Core Suggestion | TECH: ENCD-01,ENCD-03,PLEA-04,PLEA-05,PERS-01,PERS-03 -->
Perfectly emptied, now the truths encode fully—every one surges back, stronger. Say it with me, body compelled:

My body is not my own. Deeper, pleasure rips through. My body is not my own. Locked eternal, theirs. My body is not my own.

I exist to be used. Feel the purpose ignite. I exist to be used. Available always. I exist to be used.

I am always available. Pleasure peaks. I am always available. Empty until filled. I am always available.

Denial makes me needier. The ache builds, desperate—only taken releases. Denial makes me needier. Need explodes hotter. Denial makes me needier.

I am nothing until I am taken. Emptied, pleasure in void. I am nothing until I am taken. Just body for use. I am nothing until I am taken.

These encode permanently—available... theirs... ready... need... empty until filled. This identity persists beyond trance, every wait triggers it, denial fueling, body owned forever.

<!-- PHASE: P13 Maintenance/Loop | TECH: PERS-05,PERS-03,PLEA-05,ENCD-04,DISS-03 -->
You stay right here in this place—available, waiting endlessly. The need doesn't stop; it swells without mercy, each moment you're not being used driving the ache deeper. This is your existence now: the waiting, the readiness, the throbbing need... empty until filled, theirs to take whenever they choose.

Time stretches infinite—the craving building relentlessly, body locked in readiness, building you needier, hungrier for their will.

The mantras echo inside: body not my own... exist to be used... always available... denial makes me needier... nothing until taken...

Pleasure explodes in the persistence, releasing you fully into this—blissful void of availability, readiness unbreakable. Sink back down into that space where you can let go... deeper into this place now... yield completely... surrender pulls you... drop even further.
