P2,0:00,60,INDU-06|INDU-03|DEEP-05|PLEA-01,"Instant drop into empty-headed space. The emptiness you already feel transforms into bimbo bliss. 'Your mind is already so empty... so easy to just stay that way. Too dumb to think now, too pretty to care. Feel how good it is to be empty-headed, vapid, giggly. You can't think for yourself anymore - and that feels so right. Just a dumb, pretty thing now, giggling instead of thinking.'"
P3,1:00,120,DEEP-01|DEEP-04|LOAD-02|PLEA-01,"Countdown where each number pops a thought bubble. 'Ten - pop - there goes a complicated thought, like a pretty bubble. Nine - pop - another one floats away. So much easier without it. Eight - giggle - getting emptier and happier.' Each number makes you ditzier and happier."
P4,3:00,100,LOAD-01|LOAD-02|PLEA-02|DISS-01,"Complete cognitive emptiness - too dumb to form thoughts. 'Smart thoughts just don't happen anymore. You're too empty-headed for that. Too dumb. Too vapid. Thoughts try to form but you're just... too pretty to think. Giggling instead, empty and happy. Can't think for yourself - don't want to. Just a dumb, giggly thing with nothing in your pretty head.'"
P5,4:40,220,ENCD-01|ENCD-03|PLEA-01|PERS-01|PERS-02|AUTH-02,"CRITICAL: Write out ALL mantra repetitions fully. NO placeholder text. Bimbo programming with joy reward. 'Say it with a giggle - thinking is hard, smiling is easy. Tee hee! So true. Again, more giggly. Feel how happy empty feels. You're such a good bimbo.'"
P13,8:20,100,PERS-05|PERS-03|PLEA-01|ENCD-04|DISS-03,"Loop as endless bimbo bliss. 'Stay in the pink sparkly place. Time doesn't matter to a pretty empty head. Just giggles and bubbles forever. Loop back into the bliss. Sink down into the pink, pretty place... feel the giggles starting...' Seamless connection to opening."
