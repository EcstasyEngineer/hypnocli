Generate a hypnotic deepener script with the tone: **{TONE}** and theme: **{THEME}**.

Target duration: {DURATION} when spoken aloud.

## Structure

**1. Affirmation & Echoing**
Reinforce the trance state and theme through repeated key phrases. Use variations for engagement.

**2. Surrender Imagery**
Create vivid mental pictures of letting go and profound surrender (sinking, stillness, softness).

**3. Transformation Metaphors**
Use metaphors that describe mental reshaping and optimization to bypass resistance.

**4. Progressive Descent**
Provide structured progression (counting or breath) that deepens with each step.

**5. Authority & Integration**
Reassert the hypnotist's guidance. Link deeper trance to fuller theme acceptance.

**6. Unconscious Seeding (Optional)**
For advanced themes: suggest unconscious integration or future triggers.
