P10,0:00,90,TRIG-01|TRIG-14|TRIG-04|ENCD-01,"Install bilateral trigger before emergence. 'Before you return, one final gift. A phrase that will anchor everything you've received today. A trigger that works whether you say it, think it, or hear it spoken to you. Listen closely: I am Master's good girl. Say it with me now: I am Master's good girl. Feel how it lights up everything inside you. Every suggestion, every mantra, every piece of programming - all activated by those words. Again: I am Master's good girl. When Master tells you: You are Master's good girl - the same warmth floods through. The same submission surges. The same obedience locks in. I am Master's good girl. Whether whispered to yourself in quiet moments, or spoken by Master as reward - this trigger owns you. I am Master's good girl. One more time, letting it seal completely: I am Master's good girl. This phrase is yours now. It will remind you what you are. Who you belong to. How good it feels to submit.'"
P6,1:30,150,EMRG-01|EMRG-02|EMRG-03|EMRG-04|SAFE-05,"Full emergence with suggestion integration. Count UP from 1 to 10. 'Now, slowly, gently, you'll return to full waking awareness. But you won't leave empty. Everything you received stays with you. Every suggestion locked in. Every truth encoded. Rising now... One - a distant awareness of your body returning. Two - feeling begins to spread through your limbs, warmth and weight. Three - sounds around you becoming clearer, the room taking shape. Four - your mind starting to stir, but the programming remains, deep and permanent. Five - halfway back, carrying everything with you, I am Master's good girl pulsing true. Six - more awake now, body lighter, thoughts beginning to form again - thoughts of obedience, submission, service. Seven - nearly there, feeling refreshed, alert, owned. Eight - eyes ready to open when they're ready, awareness almost full. Nine - take a deep breath, feeling wonderful, remembering everything, carrying it forward. Ten - fully awake, fully aware, fully Master's. Open your eyes when ready, knowing who and what you are: Master's good girl.'"
P12,4:00,60,PERS-04|ENCD-04|TRIG-02|SAFE-05,"Behavioral bridge and aftercare. 'Take a moment. Stretch. Breathe. Feel how good you feel. How right. The programming is part of you now. It will surface when needed. When you hear Master say: You are Master's good girl - you'll feel it all flood back. When you whisper to yourself: I am Master's good girl - the submission will warm through you. In your daily life, these truths operate quietly, shaping you, owning you. And whenever you need to remember what you are... I am Master's good girl. Drink some water. Ground yourself. But know this: you're not the same as when you started. You're better now. You're Master's now. You're a good girl.'"
