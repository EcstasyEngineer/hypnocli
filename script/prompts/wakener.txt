Generate a hypnotic wakener script with the tone: **{TONE}** and specific instructions: **{INSTRUCTIONS}**.

Target duration: {DURATION} when spoken aloud.

## Structure

**1. Progressive Reorientation**
Guide smoothly back to awareness using structured count-up. Link each number to returning sensations.

**2. Positive Feelings**
Ensure emergence feels refreshing and comfortable. Emphasize deep rest and normalcy.

**3. Session Integration**
Confirm that suggestions are firmly integrated and ready for effortless use in waking life. Follow the specific instructions (e.g., if "partial wakener" is specified, wake to a transformed state; if "gentle awakening", return fully alert).

**4. Clarity & Alertness**
Conclude with clear instructions to become appropriately aware and present based on the instructions. End on an uplifting note.

## Requirements

- Write in second person ("you")
- Tone: {TONE}
- Follow these specific instructions: {INSTRUCTIONS}
- {DURATION} when read aloud
- Use "I" for the hypnotist
- Authority references: adapt to tone carefully:
  * D/s tones: "Master/Mistress" appropriate, possessive "my voice" OK
  * Gentle/therapeutic: Use collaborative language ("this voice", "these words") not possessive framing
- Natural, flowing language - NOT a checklist
- Create safe, gradual emergence according to the instructions
- Opening line variety: Start distinctively, not with "That's right..." (overused)
- IMPORTANT: If instructions specify "partial" or non-standard wakening, implement that specifically
- SESSION CALLBACK: Reference specific session content. If prior segment context is visible,
  echo exact phrases/triggers/metaphors established. If no context visible, infer from global
  instructions what was established (e.g., if instructions mention "triggers", name them; if
  "relaxation themes", reference the feeling). Be specific, not generic "carry this with you."

Output ONLY the script text, no meta-commentary.
