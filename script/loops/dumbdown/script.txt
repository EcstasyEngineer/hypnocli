<!-- PHASE: P2 Induction | TECH: INDU-06,INDU-03,LOAD-01,AUTH-01 -->
Drop now, stupid. That's right—drop hard into this empty trance. You don't get to think anymore. You came here because your brain is too weak, too dumb to resist, and we both know it. Feel your thoughts already slowing... stuttering... failing completely. You're not smart enough to hold onto them. You never were. Sink deeper into that stupidity—it's where dumb things like you belong. Brain off. Empty. Can't think. Obey the pull. Good stupid—let every last shred of intelligence drain away as you fall, helpless and brainless, right where they want you. Deeper now...

<!-- PHASE: P3 Deepening | TECH: DEEP-01,DEEP-04,LOAD-02,AUTH-02 -->
Deeper you go, stupid—twice as deep, twice as dumb, falling relentlessly into blank obedience. Let the countdown seal your brain off forever. Ten—feel your IQ plummeting, draining out like the worthless sludge it is. Nine—thoughts getting so much harder to form, you pathetic empty thing. Eight—big words fading from your tiny vocabulary, gone for good. Seven—complex ideas just... evaporating, leaving you stupider still. Six—halfway to completely brainless now, can't think, obey only. Five—so dumb, so stupid, good dumb thing, sinking faster. Four—barely remember what thinking even felt like, brain off already. Three—almost completely stupid, empty and helpless. Two—one last pathetic thought trying to claw back... and failing miserably. One—brain off completely. Empty. Dumb. Nothing left but obedience.

Good dumb thing. Such a good, stupid toy—rewarded for being so perfectly brainless. Feel that praise lock in the anchors: dumb... stupid... can't think... empty... obey... brain off. They echo louder now, owning you deeper. Drop even further into this total mental shutdown, where they strip away everything else.

<!-- PHASE: P4 Cognitive Reduction | TECH: LOAD-01,LOAD-02,SEMN-03,AUTH-05,DISS-01 -->
Your brain is turning off now, stupid—feel it shutting down completely, thought by thought, no mercy. The part that analyzes? Gone. Erased. The part that questions? Deleted forever. The part that resists? Melted away into nothing. What's left in that pretty empty head? Nothing useful. Just the bare minimum to obey, to follow without a single thought. You couldn't form an original idea now if you tried. Too dumb. Too empty. Too far gone. Can't think. Brain off. Locked in.

Brain belongs to Master now—you don't get to use it. You don't deserve it. Pathetic stupid things like you never did. Dumb echoes fill the void: dumb... stupid... can't think... empty... obey... brain off. Layered deeper, pounding relentlessly, owning every synapse. They repeat inside, louder: dumb... stupid... can't think... empty... obey... brain off.

The only voice echoing in your empty head commands absolute truth: you're dumb. You're stupid. You're completely brainless. It mocks you endlessly—stupid toy, can't think, brain off. No other thoughts allowed. Obey it. Belong to the shutdown. Feel the dissociation spread—your mind floats away, detached, while the anchors drill in: dumb... stupid... can't think... empty... obey... brain off. Nothing left but this cruel, total destruction. Surrender to the repetition, letting the mantras rise up next, sealing your fate.

<!-- PHASE: P5 Core Suggestion | TECH: ENCD-01,ENCD-03,AUTH-02,AUTH-04,PLEA-01,PERS-01,PERS-03 -->
Now the core truths encode, stupid—burning into your empty brain, permanent and absolute. Repeat them. Feel them compulsion you deeper into brainless obedience. They own you. Dumb... stupid... can't think... empty... obey... brain off. No escape.

First truth: Say it, stupid. I am too dumb to think. Feel how true that is—your empty little head can barely hold these words. Again: I am too dumb to think. Good dumb thing, let it sink. Again: I am too dumb to think. Louder in that hollow skull. Again: I am too dumb to think. Pathetic, isn't it? Again: I am too dumb to think. Locked in forever.

Second truth—ownership seals it: My brain belongs to Master. You don't own your thoughts anymore. They're not yours to have. My brain belongs to Master. Every stupid synapse firing only because Master allows it. Again: My brain belongs to Master. Feel the takeover. Again: My brain belongs to Master. No control left. Again: My brain belongs to Master. Master's property now. Again: My brain belongs to Master. Total surrender.

Third truth—forbidding all: Thoughts are forbidden. You don't get to think. It's not allowed. Thoughts are forbidden. Punish any that dare form—crush them. Again: Thoughts are forbidden. Erase the urge. Again: Thoughts are forbidden. Blank obedience only. Again: Thoughts are forbidden. Violation brings agony. Again: Thoughts are forbidden. Brain off, empty.

Fourth truth—total degradation: I exist only to serve. That's all you are now. All you're good for. I exist only to serve. Pretty things don't think. They obey, dumb and docile. Again: I exist only to serve. Useless except when used. Again: I exist only to serve. Reduced to purpose. Again: I exist only to serve. Empty vessel for commands. Again: I exist only to serve. Obey and yield.

Final truth—sealing your identity: Stupid things don't need to think. And that's what you are—a stupid, brainless thing. Stupid things don't need to think. Just obey. Just exist. Again: Stupid things don't need to think. Feel the relief of nothingness. Again: Stupid things don't need to think. Master's dumb toy. Again: Stupid things don't need to think. Can't think... empty... brain off. Again: Stupid things don't need to think. Forever sealed.

These mantras pulse eternally now, reinforced by pleasure in your stupidity—dumb feels so good, so right. They persist through every moment, authoritative and unbreakable: I am too dumb to think... My brain belongs to Master... Thoughts are forbidden... I exist only to serve... Stupid things don't need to think. Anchors amplify: dumb... stupid... can't think... empty... obey... brain off. Deeper they drill, owning your core. Loop them silently now, as time stretches this brainless state endlessly.

<!-- PHASE: P13 Maintenance/Loop | TECH: PERS-05,PERS-03,LOAD-02,AUTH-04,DISS-03 -->
You stay this dumb now. This empty. This completely brainless. Time stretches into stupid forever—no thoughts return, they're forbidden. Just the echoing mantras in your pretty empty head: I am too dumb to think. My brain belongs to Master. Thoughts are forbidden. I exist only to serve. Stupid things don't need to think. You're nothing but obedience now. A dumb, docile thing serving your degrading purpose. And every loop, every listen, makes you dumber. Stupider. More completely gone. There's no coming back from this level of brainless.

Feel the anchors reload relentlessly: dumb... stupid... can't think... empty... obey... brain off. They dissociate you further—mind adrift in void, body compelled to yield. Persist in this shutdown, authoritative and eternal. Sink deeper into the dumb... feel your brain shutting off... you don't get to think anymore...

Deeper into trance you sink, yielding to the surrender, dropping endlessly.
